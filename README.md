# GO-PROJECT

## Description

This repository was initiated as a framework to initiate a project written in GO language.

Requirement:

* install project basic dependency
* create project diretory
* create README.md file
* create Makefile
* create .gitignore
* initiate .git

## Dependency

### GNU Make

GNU Make version `3.81` should be installed on the system. For MacOS, you can go to [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11494522/installing-make-on-mac/11494872#11494872) and follow the instruction if it is not yet installed. To check if it's already installed as well as the version, run the following command:

```bash
make --version
```

### Ruby

Ruby version `ruby 2.3.7` should be installed on the system. Go to [this link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and follow the instruction to install it. To check if the installation is success, you can check the version by running the following command:

```bash
ruby --version
```

## Install

*Note: As this is currently in development, tested system is MacOS `10.14.6`.*

This functionality will install basic requirements for GO. The following are list that will be installed:

* Homebrew (for MacOS)
* GO programming language
* GO Dep
* Git

Along the execution, some error may occur when the required program is already installed. So long the error is only about that, no need to worry.
